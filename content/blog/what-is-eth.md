It's becoming popular to see .eth names on Twitter profiles.

These names ending in ".eth" are just an alias to a Ethereum address. They are called ENS Domains.

Instead of using the the long hexadecimal ethereum adress you can just use someone.eth which is more user-friendly and makes it less prone to sending tokens to the wrong address.

These names, called ENS Domains, can be registered at <https://ens.domains>.
