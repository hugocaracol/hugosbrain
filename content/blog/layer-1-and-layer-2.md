title: Layer 1 and Layer 2
description: Layer 2 solves the problem of scalability of the blockchain
---
## Layer 1
It's the base layer blockchain implementation
- Bitcoin
- Ethereum
- Avalanche
- ...

Lacks scalability which is offered by Layer 2 solutions.

## Layer 2
It's built on top of main network to improve scalability
- Polygon (MATIC)
- Lightning Network
- ...

Offers high throughput (fast transactions).

> "By abstracting the majority of data processing to auxiliary architecture, the base layer blockchain becomes less congested â€” and ultimately more scalable."
